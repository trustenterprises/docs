# Overview

[This Laravel package](https://github.com/trustenterprises/laravel-hashgraph) allows SaaS builders to integrate with distributed ledger technology, Hedera Hashgraph, at minimal effort and cost.

It is effectively **proof of anything** packaged up, for free, and with no overhead.

There are 2 methods to configure this package.

If you are just getting started with Trust Enterprises and you will use Laravel, [we recommend that you use this link](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftrustenterprises%2Fhedera-serverless-api\&env=HEDERA\_ACCOUNT\_ID,HEDERA\_PRIVATE\_KEY,API\_SECRET\_KEY,HEDERA\_NETWORK,WEBHOOK\_URL\&envDescription=Enter%20your%20account%20id%20and%20private%20key%20from%20the%20hedera%20portal.%20The%20API%20secret%20is%20your%20authentication%20key%20to%20communicate%20with%20your%20API%2C%20create%20a%20secure%20string%20of%20at%20least%2010%20characters.\&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.trust.enterprises%2Fdeployment%2Fenvironment-variables\&redirect-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.trust.enterprises%2Frest-api%2Foverview), which includes the **WEBHOOK\_URL** configuration when initially creating your client.

Alternatively, adding the **WEBHOOK\_URL** as a new environment variable in your project settings. You will have to **redeploy your client for the changes to take effect.**

> If you are testing locally use ngrok or localhost.run to create a tunnel to your local app.

### A brief overview

A Laravel client library to automate adding webhooks, feeding the trust responses into your database automatically.

1. A fluent PHP API that communicates with the REST API.
2. Inbuilt database consensus table migrations that contain the bare bones of tables you need to have a stored log.&#x20;
3. The webhook flow will automatically store and validate all incoming consensus timestamp responses.
4. Custom events on insert events so that you may easily add additional logic if required.
