# Getting Started

## The introductory video course ðŸ¤©

Wanna grab a coffee and want to chill out for 30 minutes with me and step through the entire process of deploying a Trust Enterprises API client and interaction with a fresh Laravel app, [follow this link](https://docs.trust.enterprises/intro-video-course/introduction-of-the-trust-enterprises-project) ðŸš€

## The Goal

Your starting point, an API to connect your software (SaaS) to the world of tokens, consensus using Hedera Hashgraph, at the lowest time cost, while owning the deployment, keeping control of the private keys and without any additional microservice overhead.

{% hint style="info" %}
This serverless client for hedera hashgraph is released on mainnet, there are issues and tasks we are currently working on, if you find anything that doesn't seem right [raise an issue.](https://github.com/trustenterprises/hedera-serverless-consensus/issues)
{% endhint %}

You can find out about the current [beta release](https://github.com/trustenterprises/hedera-serverless-consensus/projects/1) and [mainnet progress](https://github.com/trustenterprises/hedera-serverless-consensus/projects/2) with the project by in our [Github projects](https://github.com/trustenterprises/hedera-serverless-consensus/projects).

## What to expect

These are the steps you'll need to follow to start using your hedera hashgraph REST API.

* [Register an account on the hedera portal](https://portal.hedera.com/register) and generate your testnet or previewnet credentials.
* Use the [deploy button from the project](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftrustenterprises%2Fhedera-serverless-api\&env=HEDERA\_ACCOUNT\_ID,HEDERA\_PRIVATE\_KEY,API\_SECRET\_KEY,HEDERA\_NETWORK\&envDescription=Enter%20your%20account%20id%20and%20private%20key%20from%20the%20hedera%20portal.%20The%20API%20secret%20is%20your%20authentication%20key%20to%20communicate%20with%20your%20API%2C%20create%20a%20secure%20string%20of%20at%20least%2010%20characters.\&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.trust.enterprises%2Fdeployment%2Fenvironment-variables\&redirect-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.trust.enterprises%2Frest-api%2Foverview) to start the deploy flow with Vercel.
* Start sending requests to your own API, upon successful deployment.

{% hint style="info" %}
We will offer a trial sandbox environment on testnet for those to experiment with the features in the API.
{% endhint %}

In addition, you may update your secrets in your newly generated Github repository in order to use the inbuilt [Github Actions CI flow](https://app.gitbook.com/@flyinggazelle/s/serverless-hedera/deployment/github-actions).
